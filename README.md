# INFO 441 Final Project

## Project Description
### Who is our target audience?
Our application will be crafted for competitive Wordle enthusiasts who are looking to amp up the excitement of their favorite game. The web app primarily appeals to enthusiastic young adults who want to challenge their friends and others as an escape from their busy lives. Students and young professionals often have very busy schedules, and our application provides a nice break from their responsibilities. 

The 1-versus-1 style of our game targets those who enjoy connecting through gaming. Additionally, casual and non-gamers can partake in our app as the game is simple to understand yet challenging enough to be entertaining. The game's fast-paced nature allows users to play during short breaks, which is a great fit for a busy young adult’s lifestyle. 

Also, considering how young adults often room with others, our application is the perfect addition to their entertainment choices. The app's simplicity paired with Wordle's addictiveness results in a socially engaging and interactive experience for users.
### Why does our audience want to use our application?
Our audience is filled with college students and young professionals, so the quickness of our game is appealing as it can provide a much-needed break from whatever activity our busy demographic is partaking in. It also allows users to engage in friendly competition with their peers, such as roommates or co-workers, in real time. In addition, our application provides a straightforward, stimulating experience for word game enthusiasts to engage in while also working on their mental sharpness.
### Why do we as developers want to build this application?
Considering that we are college students ourselves and fall into our target audience, we directly understand what an application like this would provide. It is very easy to get burnt out during a long coding session, and having an easy break that isn't just scrolling through Instagram would be very convenient. We also see the importance of social bonding, and having a game where we can have simple and friendly competition would be a nice addition to our daily lives. These benefits are part of what drives us to build this application. 

As developers, we hope to bring this project to life so our target audience and beyond have access to what we believe to be a perfect addition to our daily lives. Given the power of software and our own technical skills, we believe that we have the tools to build an application that will remain a staple in both our own lives and the lives of other young adults.
